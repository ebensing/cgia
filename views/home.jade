                | We are constantly leaking data into the outside world, and as technology advances 
                | and becomes cheaper, this data is increasingly being collected and stored. 
                | This is happening in both physical and virtual spaces, and goes largely unnoticed. 
                | This project is designed to be both a teaching tool and a forum for discussion about 
                | data, privacy, and surveillance in our lives today and in the future.
